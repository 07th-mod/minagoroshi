# PS3 Voice and Graphics Patch (in progress)

Currently hosting only the automated placed lines. All files need manual fixing, **do not place them on your game**.

README's going to be updated as the patch is developed. Refer to our [wiki](https://07th-mod.com/wiki) for more details about the patch.

Old collaborators welcome to join the repository, however it's still preferred to fork the repository and update through pull requests.
